# Backlog — Bugs

This is an informal idea/issue capture list — not a specification. It exists to hold known bugs until
they're ready to become a real spec.

1. long press action on a Record tile on the Observation Details screen only works at the top of the tile, but should be
   applicable for the whole tile
2. do not use dismiss animation for modals
3. A second chart tap landing just after a window switch acts on the chart the switch is replacing. Reproduced
   on the emulator: at `1Y` on `mixed metrics`, tapping one aggregated `dense` point and then another ~200ms
   later zoomed to the first point's window (correct) and then opened a Record dated outside that window
   entirely — resolved against the previous window's series. `loadingTrends` is meant to swallow the second
   tap, and does not here: it is set inside `loadTrendData`, which runs from a `useFocusEffect`, so a render
   commits first in which the selection is already the new one, the fetched range and Records are still the
   old ones, and `loadingTrends` is still false. A tap in that gap is accepted against a chart drawn from
   stale data. Wide enough to hit reliably on the emulator, where five Skia charts re-render before the
   passive effect runs. Not specific to zoom — the TimeRangeSelector's own `disabled` reads the same flag,
   set the same way, so the presets likely have the same gap (not driven on-device, inferred from the code).
   Guarding on `loadingTrends` alone cannot close it; the tap handler would need to notice that the rendered
   window no longer matches the active selection, or the flag would have to be set before the render commits.
4. Saving a new Observation without mandatory fields results in a system error modal.
5. On the Create Observation screen when there are more elements to display than the device screen can fit, the Add
   Metric button is overlapped by the Create Observation button.
6. It is possible to create multiple Observations with the same name.
